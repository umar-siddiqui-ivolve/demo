# WEB-CLIENT

# Introduction:

This is the front-end of our project.

# CICD

## Server

This service should deploy on `ngnix`

## .ENV

Update your .env as per requirements in .env.dev

## Config

First change the variable `DEVELOPMENT_ENV` to false in config/config.js file.
Before deployment, make sure that node with version 10 or greater is installed on the machine.

# How to setup repository

### Follow these steps:

1.  npm install
2.  npm run build -> this will create a dist folder
3.  copy this dist folder to ms-middleware/

# Debugging Standards

#### 1. Add `DEVELOPMENT_ENV` in .env file

```bash
## Enable or Disable development environment, should be false in production environment
DEVELOPMENT_ENV = true
```

-   If you want logs in console tab then set `DEVELOPMENT_ENV` to true.
-   False in `DEVELOPMENT_ENV` will not show any information in console tab.

#### 2. Runtime Debugging in Web-Client

-   You can enable logs and other information of console tab runtime in development environment or in production environment by setting up <b>`debug`</b> to <b>`true`</b> from local storage tab and refresh.
-   You can disable console logs in both environments by setting <b>`false`</b> to <b>`debug`</b> in application/local storage tab.

# Logging Standards

#### 1. Use Proper Log Commands

To enhance development method we separated the a class for logging the events such as log, warning and error. Instead of using `console.log()` or `console.error()` you can simply write the `Console.log()` <b>(with capital C)</b>.

-   `Console.log()` should be used for logging any events, notifications, info or any success message.
-   `Console.warn()` should be used for logging warning messages in microservices.
-   `Console.error()` should be used for logging custom errors and exceptions.
-   `Console.exception()` should be used for exception logging.

#### 2. Add Proper LOG_TARGET in .env

```bash
# logging target should be "console" | "kibana" | "both"
LOG_TARGET = both
```

-   Set `console` for only showing logs in console.
-   Set `kibana` for only send logs to kibana, don't show in console.
-   Set `both` for both showing in console and sending to kibana.

## Steps for the installation and configuration of prettier & eslint

### Prettier

-   npm install prettier -D
-   Open Settings in vs code and search wordwrap
-   If wordwrap is off, simply on it
-   CTRL + Shift + P
-   Preferences: Configure language specific settings
-   Search Javascript
-   Add the following lines in the file

```bash
{
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.formatOnPaste": true,
    "window.zoomLevel": 1,
    "javascript.updateImportsOnFileMove.enabled": "always",
    "explorer.confirmDelete": false,
    "debug.toolBarLocation": "docked",
    "debug.node.autoAttach": "on",
    "editor.wordWrap": "on",
    "[javascript]": {
        "editor.formatOnSave": true,
        "editor.formatOnPaste": true
    }
}
```

Create .pritterrc.js file in the root folder and add the following code

```bash
module.exports = {
    trailingComma: 'es5',
    tabWidth: 4,
    semi: true,
    singleQuote: true,
}
```

### ESLINT

-   npm i -D eslint eslint-config-airbnb-base eslint-plugin-import

Create .eslintrc.js file in the root folder and add the following code

```bash
const { strictEslint } = require('@umijs/fabric');

module.exports = {
    ...strictEslint,
    globals: {
        ANT_DESIGN_PRO_ONLY_DO_NOT_USE_IN_YOUR_PRODUCTION: true,
        page: true,
    },
};
```
